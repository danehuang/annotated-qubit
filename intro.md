# The Annotated Qubit

We provide an introduction to quantum computing (QC) and quantum information (QI).
The series of notes are partially based off of an advanced undergraduate/graduate
course taught at San Francisco State University (SFSU). The series of notebooks has
several parts:
1. Foundations: introduction to single qubit systems.
2. Foundations II: introduction to multi-qubit systems.
3. QI: basic quantum information.
4. QC: basic quantum computing algorithms.
5. Shor's: Shor's algorithm (advanced quantum computing algorithm).
